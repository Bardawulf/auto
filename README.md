# Automotive Ontology (AUTO)
The AUTOMOTIVE ONTOLOGY (AUTO) defines the shared conceptual structures in the automotive industry. It is an OWL ontology. It is built upon the auto schema.org extension created by the W3C Automotive Ontology Community Group. AUTO's development process follows the best practices established by the EDMC FIBO Community.
