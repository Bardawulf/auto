		<skos:example>A vehicle equipped with level 1 adaptive cruise control, level 1 lane centering, and a level 3 ADS feature designed to perform the complete DDT during traffic jams on fully access-controlled freeways. The level 3 ADS traffic jam feature requires the user to drive the vehicle to the freeway before engaging the feature, as well as again driving the vehicle upon exiting the freeway in order to complete the trip.</skos:example>
		<skos:example>A vehicle with no driving automation system features that is designed to be operated by a conventional driver throughout all trips.</skos:example>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>A conventional vehicle may be equipped with one or more level 1 or 2 driving automation system features that support the driver in performing the DDT, but do not perform the complete DDT, as well as level 3 and 4 ADS features that require a conventional driver to operate the vehicle during portions of each trip.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>While it may be counterintuitive to call a vehicle equipped with an ADS “conventional,” it is appropriate in this context because a conventional driver is required for at least part of every trip. As emphasized below, J3016 classifies the driving automation level of features rather than of vehicles (although, in the special case of an ADS-DV, the classification of the ADS and the vehicle are effectively the same).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Only ADS-equipped vehicles capable of driverless operation (namely, an ADS-DV or a dual-mode vehicle) are potentially subject to being dispatched.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The term “dispatch” as used outside of the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, is generally understood to mean sending a particular vehicle to a particular pick-up or drop-off location for purposes of providing a transportation service. In the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, and as used herein, this term includes software-enabled dispatch of multiple ADS-equipped vehicles in driverless operation that may complete multiple trips involving pick-up and drop-off of passengers or goods throughout a day or other pre-defined period of service, and which may involve multiple agents performing various tasks related to the dispatch function. In order to highlight this specialized use of the term dispatch, the term is modified and conditioned by the stipulation that it refers exclusively to dispatching vehicles in driverless operation. Consideration of whether a more appropriate term and definition should be specified for this concept will be taken up in the next revision of J3016, which will be developed jointly with ISO.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:comment>All of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding the strategic functions such as trip scheduling and selection of destinations and waypoints, and including without limitation:
Lateral vehicle motion control via steering (operational);
Longitudinal vehicle motion control via acceleration and deceleration (operational);

Object and event response execution (operational and tactical);
Maneuver planning (tactical); and

		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Figure 1 displays a schematic view of the driving task. For more information on the differences between operational, tactical, and strategic functions of driving, 

Figure 1 - http://sopek.net/aco/f1.jpg

For purposes of DDT performance, level 1 encompasses automation of part of the innermost loop (i.e., either lateral vehicle motion control functionality or longitudinal vehicle motion control functionality and limited OEDR associated with the given axis of vehicle motion control); level 2 encompasses automation of the innermost loop (lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control and limited OEDR associated with vehicle motion control), and levels 3-5 encompass automation of both inner loops (lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control and complete OEDR). Note that DDT performance does not include strategic aspects of driving (e.g., determining whether, when and where to travel).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>For simplification and to provide a useful shorthand term, subtasks (3) and (4) are referred to collectively as object and event detection and response (OEDR)</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>In this document, reference is made to “complete(ing) the DDT.” This means fully performing all of the subtasks of the DDT, whether by the (human) driver, by the driving automation system, or by both</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:comment>The response by the user to either perform the DDT or achieve a minimal risk condition after occurrence of a DDT performance-relevant system failure(s) or upon operational design domain (ODD) exit, or the response by an ADS to achieve minimal risk condition, given the same circumstances.</rdfs:comment>
		<skos:example>A level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) feature experiences a system failure that causes the feature to stop performing its intended function. The human driver performs the DDT fallback by resuming performance of the complete DDT.</skos:example>
		<skos:example>A level 3 ADS feature that performs the entire DDT during traffic jams on freeways is not able to do so when it encounters a crash scene and therefore issues a request to intervene to the DDT fallback-ready user. S/he responds by taking over performance of the entire DDT in order to maneuver around the crash scene. (Note that in this example, a minimal risk condition is not needed or achieved.)</skos:example>
		<skos:example>A level 4 ADS-dedicated vehicle (ADS-DV) that performs the entire DDT within a geo-fenced city center experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure. In response, the ADS-DV performs the DDT fallback by turning on the hazard flashers, maneuvering the vehicle to the road shoulder and parking it, before automatically summoning emergency assistance. (Note that in this example, the ADS-DV automatically achieves a minimal risk condition.)</skos:example>
		<skos:scopeNote>[DYNAMIC DRIVING TASK (DDT)]</skos:scopeNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>At level 3, an ADS is capable of continuing to perform the DDT for at least several seconds after providing the fallback-ready user with a request to intervene. The DDT fallback-ready user is then expected to achieve a minimal risk condition if s/he determines it to be necessary.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>At levels 4 and 5, the ADS must be capable of performing the DDT fallback and achieving a minimal risk condition. Level 4 and 5 ADS-equipped vehicles that are designed to also accommodate operation by a driver (whether conventional or remote) may allow a user to perform the DDT fallback if s/he chooses to do so. However, a level 4 or 5 ADS need not be designed to allow a user to perform DDT fallback and, indeed, may be designed to disallow it in order to reduce crash risk (see 8.9).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>Some level 3 features may be designed to automatically perform the fallback and achieve a minimal risk condition in some circumstances, such as when an obstacle-free, adjacent shoulder is present, but not in others, such as when no such road shoulder is available. The assignment of level 3 therefore does not restrict the ADS from automatically achieving the MRC, but it cannot guarantee automated achievement of MRC in all cases within its ODD. Moreover, automated MRC achievement in some, but not all, circumstances that demand it does not constitute level 4 functionality.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>The DDT and the DDT fallback are distinct functions, and the capability to perform one does not necessarily entail the ability to perform the other. Thus, a level 3 ADS, which is capable of performing the entire DDT within its ODD, may not be capable of performing the DDT fallback in all situations that require it and thus will issue a request to intervene to the DDT fallback-ready user when necessary.</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
		<AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>While a level 4 or 5 ADS is performing the DDT fallback, it may be limited by design in speed and/or range of lateral and/or longitudinal vehicle motion control (i.e., it may enter so-called “limp-home mode”).</AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote>
