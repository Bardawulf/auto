Weight classification is based on curb weight, the weight of an automobile with standard equipment and a full complement of fuel and other fluids, but with no load of persons or property. Before classification, wheelbase should be rounded to the nearest inch and curb weight should be rounded to the nearest 100 pounds.</skos:definition>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">A work zone is an area of a trafficway where construction, maintenance or utility work activities are identified by warning signs/signals/indicators, including those on transport devices (e.g., signs, flashing lights, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, flagmen, warning signs and arrow boards mounted on the vehicles in a mobile maintenance activity) that mark the beginning and end of a construction, maintenance or utility work activity. It extends from the first warning sign, signal or flashing lights to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last traffic control device pertinent for that work activity. Work zones also include roadway sections where there is ongoing, moving (mobile) work activity such as lane line painting or roadside mowing only if the beginning of the ongoing, moving (mobile) work activity is designated by warning signs or signals.</skos:definition>
